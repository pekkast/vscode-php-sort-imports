PHP Import Sorting

## Features

This small extension will sort your php imports by length or alphabetically on save (default setting) or via command `phpSortImports.sort`. If you want to save a specifi file without sorting on save you can use the `phpSortImports.saveWithoutSorting` command or disable the `onSave` setting.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `phpSortImports.onSave`: Automatically sort imports on save
* `phpSortImports.sorting`: Sort by 'length' or 'alphabetically'
* `phpSortImports.suppressWarnings`: Suppress warnings when sorting fails
